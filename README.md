## SOLID

Laravel SOLID Design pattern with examples

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles that states: "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification." In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to a class or module without changing its existing code. This principle helps you write code that’s flexible, extensible, and easier to maintain.

Example Project: Payment Gateway Integration in Laravel
Imagine you’re building an e-commerce application in Laravel where users can make payments using different payment providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, etc.). With the Open/Closed Principle in mind, you’ll set up a structure where adding a new payment gateway doesn’t require modifying existing code but instead involves extending it with new classes.
